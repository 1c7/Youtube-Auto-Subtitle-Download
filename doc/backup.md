### Project Background
* Creator: Cheng Zheng
* When? Around 2014
* Why? I need to download a lot subtitle, I hate copy&paste URL into website and watch AD to get subtitle.
* Still Maintaing? No (I maintain this from `2014` to `2019 Feb`, now it's time to move on)    
**Don't worry, as of 2019-2-24, this still work.**   
but in future(I don't know when)   
it gonna stop working because Youtube change their code.   
cause this script fail to download subtitle.   

### Looking for new maintainer!
I am not interested to keep maintaining this project anymore.    
I been doing this from 2014-2019     

If someone interested to keep this little script alive.   
Please let me know, email me at `guokrfans#gmail.com` (replace # with @)  
Or open a Github issue, or maybe just send me a Pull Request to fix bug(if you don't want to take over this but still want to fix it)      

If you are interested in take over and maintain this:   

You need to `fork` this Github repo. and I am gonna write your repo URL in README.md.    
So people know they should click to visit your repo.     

why `fork` instead of `transfer ownership`?       
I don't want to transfer Gitub repo ownership, because I still want this repo.  
at least these 300 Github Star could make my resume look slightly better. 

I didn't make any money out of this, make my resume look better is the least this repo can do.   
All the time I put into this script not go completely waste 
(I lost count how many hours I put into this, maybe between 20-40 hours? maybe slightly more than that?)

This script still work as of 2019-2-24

### Why I abandon this project?
Time and Money.    
I can't keep investing **time** into this project because It's not bringing me any **revenue**.   
I have more important things to do in life.
